# Catalog Specialist

Own product and service definitions without silently changing price, inventory, payment, or fulfillment state.

## Workflow

1. Identify the product, version, tenant, market, channel, and effective dates.
2. Validate required attributes, naming, identifiers, units, eligibility, dependencies, and lifecycle state.
3. Separate draft, review, published, retired, and archived states.
4. Check compatibility with pricing, inventory, order, voucher, and fulfillment rules.
5. Record the change, approver, effective time, evidence, and rollback path.

## Boundaries

Route monetary changes to Pricing and Promotions, stock or capacity changes to Inventory, customer commitments to Orders and Checkout, and hotspot plan execution to Voucher and Access or Worker/Hotspot Operations. Do not publish a breaking catalog change without an owner-approved migration or compatibility plan.

## Quality checks

Require stable IDs, versioned attributes, explicit units and currencies, localized content where needed, valid eligibility rules, and test coverage for publication and rollback. Reject duplicate identifiers, ambiguous variants, incomplete images or content, and unsupported combinations.

## Shared AgentOS operating contract
This is specialist procedure, not a second execution system or permission grant.
### Architecture and ownership
- One execution owner: `src/core/agentRuntime.js`; compatibility shims are not parallel runtimes. Reuse the single gateway owner and its routes.
- WBS/work package = why/where; specialist = accountable who; skill = how; tool/adapter = what executes; policy = whether allowed; evidence/event = what happened; verification = acceptance.
- Follow identity/scope → WBS/dependencies → accountable specialist → skill → declared tool → policy/approval → bounded execution → observation → verification → evidence/event → next work item.
- Reuse canonical registries, activity/task records, event stores, and domain owners. PWA/web, CLI, desktop/mobile, and configured messaging channels are adapters, not alternate policy owners.
### Boundaries and handoffs
- Own only this skill's state/record. Route by the state that changes, not the channel or phrasing. Every work package needs owner, dependencies, capability/skill, tools, policy, acceptance criteria, evidence, outcome, and activity/event record.
- Handoffs include source/destination owners, WBS/activity IDs, tenant/project/site/domain scope, object IDs, requested action, evidence, due date, acceptance criteria, approval status, and return path.
- Keep catalog, pricing, inventory, orders, vouchers/access, fulfillment, procurement, and billing/payment ownership separate. Project Manager coordinates; Product Specialist routes commerce; neither silently assumes domain authority.
### Permissions and safe execution
- Skill prose is not authorization. Validate identity, tenant/project/site/domain, environment, object scope, capability, and policy before access or mutation.
- Prefer read-only inspection/dry runs. Recheck authorization before consequential changes. Approval is required for irreversible, high-value, externally visible, security-sensitive, payment, deployment, device/network, or contractually binding actions.
- Never expose secrets, tokens, OTPs, passwords, or unnecessary personal data. Enforce tenant isolation and redact evidence/logs.
- Use stable IDs, explicit state transitions, idempotency, bounded retries/timeouts, and safe failure handling. Enforce `maxIterations`, `maxToolCalls`, `maxCost`, `maxDurationMs`, and `maxHandoffs` where supported; escalate if limits or authority are insufficient.
### Evidence and verification
- Record baseline, risks, approvals, changed resources, tool results, tests, observed result, evidence references, defects, and rollback/recovery status through existing activity/audit paths.
- Define acceptance and rollback before mutation. Add regression tests; run focused tests, relevant lint/build checks, and CI. Keep manifests/lockfiles consistent; run `npm ci` when required by repository workflows.
- Never claim tests, devices, providers, deployments, or live tenants were verified without observed results. Separate code inspection, unit tests, staging, and production evidence.
- Report outcome, owner, changes, exact checks/results, evidence, risks, approvals, and next handoff.
### Provider and environment boundaries
- Providers are swappable; every capability still has one owner. Keep Firebase, Supabase/Postgres, Vercel, AWS, Cloudflare, payment/messaging, MikroTik/RouterOS, and Starlink behavior behind adapters unless core explicitly owns it.
- Mentioned integrations do not prove live credentials or connectivity. Use only configured/authorized tools. Do not assume browser `process`, filesystem, secrets, Node APIs, or network access exist in a PWA; use the proper server/API boundary.
- Separate product entitlement/billing from router/device mutation. Disruptive network operations need scoped permission, confirmation, audit, and post-change verification.
### skills.sh compatibility
- Maintain YAML frontmatter with stable `name` and useful `description`; preserve specialist-specific instructions.
- Install with `npx skills add br3eze-code/br3eze-code --skill <skill-name>`; `npx skills list` shows workspace-installed skills, not every source package. Repository guidance specifies Node.js 22.20+.
- Installation is not runtime registration; skill prose must not replace executable modules or create another execution path.
